# mainSo, now you have downloaded our folder and need instructions on how everything works.
Thats what this file is for.
Anytime you are confused or forget whats up, just open this file for reference to whats going on!
Anyway, heres the whole propaganda:

~~~Verified Games~~~

Verified games are just games tested and checked by us.
There is really nothing more or nothing less to it.
Just one disclaimer, some games in the "main.html" may not work, "main.html" is sort of a testing playground for us.

~~~Unverified Games~~~

Unverified games are safe to have on your computer.
They are just unverified because they are untested, and wont be maintained.
That means we don't know if they work or not!

BIG TIP!!!
	On unverified games there will sometimes (Usually) be a "Back to home page" button, DONT PRESS IT!!!
	It may open websites that are most likely blocked and will be added to your search history!!
	Never press "Back to home page"!!!!!!!

~~~Version~~~

The version is just a way to see if you are up-to-date or not.
If you are not up-to-date that means nothing, you can still play.
You just may miss out on some more games that were added in new updates.

~~~Notice~~~

	step 2) press "code"
	step 3) press "Download ZIP"
	step 4) open your files
	step 5) create a folder and name it whatever you want (Tip: don't name it stuff like "Games" or "RogersResources", maybe something like "ELAR notes" or "Homework lists")
	step 6) put the downloaded zip file in your folder
	step 7) right click the zip (2 finger tap)
