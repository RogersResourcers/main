So, now you have downloaded our folder and need instructions on how everything works.
Thats what this file is for.
Anytime you are confused or forget whats up, just open this file for reference to whats going on!
Anyway, heres the whole propaganda:

~~~Version~~~

The version is just a way to see if you are up-to-date or not.
If you are not up-to-date that means nothing, you can still play.
You just may miss out on some more games that were added in new updates.

~~~Notice~~~

Want to update your version?
Visit our github!
https://github.com/RogersResourcers/main

How to download:
	step 1) open our github page. (https://github.com/RogersResourcers/main)
	step 2) press "code"
	step 3) press "Download ZIP"
	step 4) open your files
	step 5) create a folder and name it whatever you want (Tip: don't name it stuff like "Games" or "RogersResources", maybe something like "ELAR notes" or "Homework lists")
	step 6) put the downloaded zip file in your folder
	step 7) right click the zip (2 finger tap)
	step 8) press "extract here"
	
	That should make a "RogersResources" folder or a "main-main" folder in your folder that you made. 
	The "RogersResources" or "main-main" folder will contain all the games you could wish for.
